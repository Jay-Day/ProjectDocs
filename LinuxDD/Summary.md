<s> Sharing drives for games with platforms such as steam and bnet is aggrivating. 
I will figure this out but it may just take some time.

Ended up converting entirely to linux and wiping the drive to reinstall certain games.

#### Things I haven't checked yet:

- VR
- Racing Sim (wheel/Pedals)

#### Things that do NOT work with Linux:
- Call of Duty (some kind of Kernal Level Anti Cheat?)

#### Annoyances
- nothing like QMK toolbox for Linux
