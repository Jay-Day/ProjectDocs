1. Download and Install [RMG](https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases/download/v0.7.8/RMG-Setup-Windows64-v0.7.8.exe)
Easy to use emulator that's pretty stable. Netplay has some problems that super competitive folks dislike but for us it's fine.


2. Get the [smash ROM](https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/Nintendo%20-%20Nintendo%2064%20(BigEndian)/Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20%28USA%29.zip)
Or just ask me and I can send it to you.
Extract it somewhere.

3. Patch your original SSB64 Rom for REMIX (adds in more characters and QoL settings)

6. Settings -> Input (I don't know much about this because I use a raphnet adapter which allows the controller to be read just like how an N64 reads the controller data.)
   I assume you just map these controls ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c467bb-59db-4191-b614-92e8d89d3089)
